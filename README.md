# travel-tracker
A full-stack web application that allows users to insert any countries they visited, and displays a world map of all the visited countries. 

I primarly worked on the backend portion for this project with a focus on utilizing PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, NodeJs, and ExpressJS. 

Note: This is a just a coding exercise/challenge for "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy by Angela Yu.
